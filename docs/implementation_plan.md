# Route53 Automation Implementation Plan

## Project Goals
1. Create a reliable and maintainable Python library for automating AWS Route53 DNS operations
2. Provide robust error handling and rate limiting to prevent API throttling
3. Ensure type safety and code quality through comprehensive testing and static analysis
4. Make the library easy to use and integrate into other projects

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [x] Basic Route53 client setup
- [x] Session management
- [x] Basic record operations (create, read, update, delete)

### Phase 2: Reliability & Safety (Current Phase)
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [x] Add rate limiting to prevent API throttling
- [ ] Add proper type hints to all functions
- [ ] Fix all mypy and flake8 issues
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ test coverage

### Phase 3: Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all public functions
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Add integration test examples

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create changelog
- [ ] Package for PyPI distribution

## Current Status
We are currently in Phase 2, focusing on making the library more reliable and safer to use. Recent additions of error handling and rate limiting are key steps toward this goal, but we need to ensure type safety and code quality through proper type hints and fixing static analysis issues.

## Next Steps
1. Complete the type hints implementation
2. Fix static analysis issues (mypy, flake8)
3. Add remaining test coverage
4. Begin documenting the public API
