# Route53 Automation Build Research

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.12 (per project requirements)
- boto3 for AWS interaction
- UV for package management

## Development Tools & Standards
- Type Checking: mypy for static type analysis
- Code Style: flake8 and black for code formatting
- Testing: pytest for unit tests
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement

## Rate Limiting Research
Rate limiting is crucial for Route53 API interaction as AWS imposes the following limits:
- 5 requests per second for API operations
- Burst capacity available but should not be relied upon
- Different limits for different operation types

Our implementation uses a token bucket algorithm to:
- Maintain steady request rate
- Handle burst scenarios gracefully
- Prevent API throttling

## Error Handling Strategy
Common Route53 API errors that need handling:
1. Throttling errors (ThrottlingException)
2. Invalid input errors (InvalidInput)
3. Authorization errors (AccessDenied)
4. Resource conflicts (ConflictingDomainExists)
5. Network and timeout errors

Our approach:
- Custom exception classes for different error types
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Clear error messages for client usage
- Proper logging of error conditions

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Mock AWS responses
   - Test error handling paths
   - Verify rate limiting behavior
   - Test edge cases

2. Integration Tests (Planned)
   - Test with actual Route53 API
   - Use test domains for verification
   - Measure actual rate limiting effectiveness

## Security Considerations
- Use IAM roles and least privilege access
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure handling of sensitive DNS data
- Input validation to prevent injection

## Performance Optimization
Current focus areas:
1. Efficient rate limiting implementation
2. Minimal memory footprint
3. Fast error handling paths
4. Resource cleanup

## Future Considerations
- Async support for better performance
- Batch operations for multiple records
- DNS zone management features
- Integration with other AWS services
